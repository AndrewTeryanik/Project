                         <img src="../Images/Enemy/Dark%20Archers.jpg" alt="Dark Archers"><br><p>Dark Archers: Other the most popular enemy in the game, wearing the birdlike mask on the face, equipped with the arch and the infinite amount of arrows. Although weaker than the Guard, he may constitute the real threat, especially when he is shooting from hard accessible place. In direct clash he has no chances at all so you may eliminate him using the speed kill attack.</p> <br>

                          <img src="../Images/Enemy/Thrall.jpg" alt="Thrall"><p> Thrall: He is taking the place of Guard in later levels of the game. This mighty muscleman is attired with the amour (although there are specimen with naked torso), and carries the iron headgear on the head. Equipped with the saber, the mace or the hatchet, is able to inflict considerable wounds. He is significantly stronger than the Guard and more resistant to blows. The fight against him is lasting the longer, and speed kill attack usually requires the bigger amount of cuts comparing to his weaker comrade.</p><br>

                         <img src="../Images/Enemy/Enchantress.jpg" alt="Enchantress"><p>Enchantress: Speed and the dancer's finesse - you may characterize the enchantress with these words. Using the combination of kicks and cuts with two long blades, she is able to inflict many wounds. The speed kill attack is no use. She isn't too resistant and therefore a few accurate blows are downing her to the ground. Her revolving kicks are dangerous, it may throw away the hero over the rail of the balcony. The attack in the group is also her advantage. Thanks to big speed of inflicting strikes, a few enchantresses may surround the prince and kill him before he will do anything.</p><br>

                         <img src="../Images/Enemy/Sand%20Gate%20Guard.jpg" alt="Sand Gate Guard"><p>Sand Gate Guard: Most numerously and most often appearing enemy, armed with the long, curved saber. Individually or in the small company, is standing on guard guarding everything literally: passages, alleys, squares, corridors, roofs and palace chambers. It is the typical muscleman attacking with no subtle method, with simple cuts with saber and kicking sometimes. It is fairly difficult to defeat but you may take him by surprise (speed kill attack).</p><br>
